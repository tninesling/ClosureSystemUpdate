# Update Algorithms for Closure Systems #

This repository contains implementations of the closure system update algorithms
described in the paper [Direct and Binary Direct Bases for One-set Updates of a Closure system](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08684) (my undergraduate thesis).

In short, a closure system is a mathematical concept with many representations.
The goal of this work was to take advantage of the efficiency of Horn clauses
in order to effect a change in the set of closed sets defined by the closure
system.

The results of this work were presented at the International Conference on
Formal Concept Analysis 2019 and subsequently published in the conference
proceedings.
