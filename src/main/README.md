The build.sbt file determines which file runs when you perform the "sbt run"
command. The LaRochelleExample file will time how long it takes to update
the typical 10x22 benchmark table with a new row. The StatisticsGeneratingExample
file will print a CSV with information about several basis implementations
adding rows to randomly generated tables
