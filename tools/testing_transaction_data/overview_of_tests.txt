4. Data used for testing:

4.1 The dataset was taken from Frequent Itemset Mining Dataset Repository, publicly available at http://fimi.ua.ac.be/data/retail.dat. This is retail market basket data from an anonymous Belgian retail store. We took first 90 rows converting them to a binary matrix format with size 90*502 and dencity 0.0162. Runnig time is about 42 seconds, results have about 104 mostly binary implications with the max. support = 5, confidence = 100% (DBasis).

4.2 Data from Honolulu Cancer Center, a matrix with size 22*1112 and dencity 0.4684, fortran code with the target columns 1111, 1112 and ternary implications, support 8 and deficit 1 gave about 14819 implications. Microsoft Association Rules gave first 2000 rows with minimum support 15 and probability = 1. There were no implications with targets 1111 and 1112. DBasis gave column 1111 reduced, and no data for 1112 column by the time of testing.
